Per pixel is done in a sliding window: the pixel to be classified is the centre pixel of the window. The window has a number of dimensions (typically r, g, b) correspsonding to the wavelengths available from the satellite. Eg., may have an extra channel for near infrared. Standard CNN used: stacked conv-layers, fc layer and finally a softmax classifiier. ReLUs have been used in conv-layer. The fc layer used here is actually a 1000 hidden unit denoising auto-encoder. Has a post processing step: pixel-by-pixel classifications are likely to involve noise - e.g., a single pixel classified as an industrial area in the middle of a field/ "salt and pepper misclassifications" SLIC and other averaging has been used here. Interestingly, paper mentions using DBSCAN - a form of density clustering to solve this.  

**idea - Can Floyd–Steinberg or similar dithering algorithm be used in the convolution process?????**

## Datasets

### Raw data

Sentinel 2 data looking the most promising. (10m resolution for R,G,B + NIF) 
(20m for shorter wavelengths). - see [MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) Overview](https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/msi-instrument) for instrument details.

**idea -- downscale higher resolution pre-labelled data to 10m per pixel if can not find pre-labelled 10m dataset**


* [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) - The Copernicus Open Access Hub (previously known as Sentinels Scientific Data Hub) provides complete, free and open access to [Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1), [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) and [Sentinel-3](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-3).
* [Satellite Applications Catapult - Data discovery hub](http://data.satapps.org/) - Very nice. Lists pretty much everything.
* [Satellite Applications Catapult - Sentinel Data Access Service (SEDAS)](https://sa.catapult.org.uk/facilities/sedas/]) - (API) portal enabling end-users to search and download data from Sentinel 1 & 2 satellites. It aims to lower barriers to entry and create the foundations for an integrated approach to satellite data access.
